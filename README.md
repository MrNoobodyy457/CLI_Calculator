# Calculator
One of my first Python projects! A simple calculator that I kept improving as I learned â€” includes a version with history.

# Python Calculator â€“ Learning Project

This is one of my **first proper coding projects** while learning Python.

The project includes two versions of the calculator:
1. **Version 1** â€“ Basic calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Version 2** â€“ Improved version with a history feature added.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

### Version 1
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Power and Root operations
- Input validation using `try-except`
- Handles division by zero
- Option to continue or stop after each calculation
- Accepts stop keywords like `n`, `no`, `stop` at any input stage

### Version 2 (With History)
- All features from Version 1
- Added history functionality (keeps track of previous calculations)
- You can view the past calculations after each operation
- Still a basic version; working on improving it further

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts I used

- `while` loops and `if-elif-else` statements
- `try-except` blocks for handling errors like:
  - invalid number input
  - division by zero
- Functions (`def`)
- Input and string handling (`input()`, `.lower()`)
- History functionality with lists (in Version 2)

## ðŸš€ Next steps

- [x] Add a history feature
- [x] Improve history feature (currently canâ€™t clear history)
- [ ] Build a simple interface someday (maybe GUI)

This project is part of my coding journey. Iâ€™ll keep uploading my progress as I learn more ðŸš€
